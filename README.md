# Real-Time-E-Commerce-Recommendation-Engine

I developed a Real-Time E-Commerce Intent Mining and Recommendation Engine to address the challenge of making on-site product suggestions more context-aware and personalized. In many retail sites, visitors see the same static recommendations regardless of their actual goals. My project solves this by inferring user intent on the fly (e.g. browsing vs. buying, preferred categories) and using that to tailor recommendations. This is critical because modern recommendation engines can dramatically boost engagement and sales – for example, about 35% of Amazon’s sales come from recommended products. In a nutshell, my system analyzes live user behavior signals, classifies their current intent, and then generates personalized product recommendations in real time, improving the shopping experience and conversion rates.
